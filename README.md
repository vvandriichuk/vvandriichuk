Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Viktor!

Since 2017, I have been actively working in the field of big data (ML Engineering, Data Engineering and Backend
Engineering) using Python and Java. I implemented several fairly loaded services up to 1000 rps during this time,
using microservice architecture and machine learning. Among them are a project for a marketing company to analyse
spam, a recommendation service for online stores, and the collection and storage of data on user behaviour on the
site. I also worked in teams creating data warehouses and datamarts for prominent clients such as PepsiCo, Deloitte,
and Appen, with a storage capacity of several terabytes. Iâ€™ve been studying algorithms for optimal downloading data
from different sources, computing big data, and storing big data. I constantly study new technologies to understand
better how they can benefit businesses. My strengths are intensive study of technologies, optimisation of bottlenecks
in the project, if necessary, starting a project from scratch and forming a team for the project.
