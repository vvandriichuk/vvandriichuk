Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Viktor!

Since 2023, I have helped businesses find insights into data to grow their businesses. I help businesses grow by making data-driven decisions and implementing data-driven solutions from developing dynamic models to implementations.<br /><br />

Since 2017, I have been actively working in big data (hands-on experience with ML Engineering, Data Engineering and Backend Engineering) using Python. During this time, I implemented several fairly loaded services up to 1000 rps, using microservice architecture and machine learning.<br /><br />

Among them are a project for a marketing company to analyse spam, a recommendation service for online stores, and the collection and storage of data on user behaviour on the site. I also worked in teams creating data warehouses and datamarts for prominent clients such as PepsiCo, Deloitte, and Appen, with a storage capacity of several terabytes.<br /><br />

Iâ€™ve been studying algorithms for optimal downloading data from different sources, computing big data, and storing big data.<br /><br />

I constantly study new technologies to understand better how they can benefit businesses. My strengths are intensive study of technologies, optimisation of bottlenecks in the project, and, if necessary, starting a project from scratch and forming a team.<br /><br />

I have 16 years of experience in IT.<br /><br />

I was started out as a PHP developer. Since 2008, I have switched to launching my own startups. These were mainly online projects for agricultural businesses, as well as in the gaming field.<br /><br />

In 2010, my company in Kyiv held gaming conferences well-known in all CIS.<br /><br />

However, over time, I lost interest in management activities and decided to return to direct development.<br /><br />
