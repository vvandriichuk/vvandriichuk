Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Viktor!

Specializing in finding optimal technical solutions for complex business problems, I utilize a comprehensive array of theoretical materials and a wealth of experience to apply best current practices uniquely tailored to each scenario. With a profound background in Python Backend Development, Machine Learning, DevOps, and data engineering, my expertise is well-suited to assist companies in these rapidly advancing sectors.<br /><br />

Skills:<br /><br />

I excel in Python programming and have extensive experience with frameworks and technologies such as FastAPI, Flask, and RESTful API. My proficiency extends to database management with MongoDB and PostgreSQL, enhancing data interaction through tools like Mongo Engine and Pydantic. I adeptly manage task queues with Celery, and utilize Docker for containerization, ensuring scalable and efficient application deployment. My experience with Alembic and Redis, along with messaging systems like RabbitMQ, strengthens backend infrastructures.<br /><br />

In Machine Learning, I specialize in Large Language Models (LLM), using tools such as LangChain and LangGraph to enhance natural language processing capabilities. My data engineering skills are demonstrated through my use of AWS services including Glue, Athena, Aurora, RedShift, and Quicksight, alongside data orchestration with Airflow and data integrity with dbt and Great Expectations. Advanced analytics and big data handling are facilitated through platforms like Spark, Snowflake, and integrations such as AWS Lambda Functions and OpenSearch.<br /><br />

Last Achievements:<br /><br />

- Under my leadership the technical team created an updated core product of the platform, which accelerated the development of client bots by 40 times and also reduced the cost of such a bot by 80 times.<br />
- I took the initiative to develop a transparent and fair system for grading our technical specialists, which also includes an effective wage calculation method. This system ensures that everyone's contributions
are recognized and valued, fostering a positive work environment.<br />
- Thanks to the development standards I set up, deploying updates has accelerated 10 times.<br /><br />
