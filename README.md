Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Viktor!

Since 2023, I realised that I donâ€™t want to do tasks only, but I want and can bring more value to businesses in the form of creating effective solutions for finding insights for business growth from start to finish (from collecting data from different sources, proper storage, creation necessary pipelines for data transformation, searching for insights in data or creating dashboards). I help businesses grow by making data-driven decisions and implementing data-driven solutions, from design to implementation. <br /><br />

I have been actively working in big data (hands-on experience with Data Engineering, ML Engineering, Data Analytics and Backend Engineering) using Python. <br /><br />

Among them are a project for a marketing company to analyse spam, a recommendation service for online stores, and the collection and storage of data on user behaviour on the site. I also worked in teams creating data warehouses and datamarts for prominent clients such as PepsiCo, Deloitte, and Appen, with a storage capacity of several terabytes. <br /><br />

Iâ€™ve been studying algorithms for optimal downloading data from different sources, computing big data, and storing big data. <br /><br />

I constantly study new technologies to understand better how they can benefit businesses. My strengths are intensive study of technologies, optimisation of bottlenecks in the project, and, if necessary, starting a project from scratch and forming a team. <br /><br />
